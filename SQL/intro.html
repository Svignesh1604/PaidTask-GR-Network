      <h2><u>Information systems, data and information</u></h2>
      <p> * The modern world is completely centered around <b>information</b> and <b>data</b>.</p><br>
      <p><b> * Data</b> is a singular unit of knowledge. It has no intrinsic value on its own. We can't extract meaning
        out of it, without knowing more about it.
      </p><br>
      <p><b> * Information</b> is something that we can link to data, to be able to attach a meaning to it.
      </p><br>
      <p> * Let me make an example. <i> number 36 is <b>data</b></i>. Knowing that <i>36 is the age of Joe is
          <b>information</b></i>.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        * Information that the data represents the age is essential knowledge that is
        key in an information system.

      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="q2" class="card">
      <h2>What is a Database? And a DBMS?</h2>
      <p> * A <b>database </b> a collection of<b> information</b> carefully organized into asystem.
      </p><br>
      <p> * The technology that in a computer system lets us organize data and represent
        the information that's essential for an information system is called
        <strong> DataBase Management System (DBMS).</strong>
      </p><br>
      <p> * A DBMS is a software that encapsulates the data of a database, and provides us a way to store it, retrieve
        it, edit it, persist it, and much more.</p><br>
      <p> * We ask a DBMS to be efficient, to privately and securely store data, to handle large amounts of data.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="q3" class="card">
      <h2>Do you always need a database?</h2>
      <p>
         * Do you always need a database for your app? Of course not.<br><br>
        *  Many times you don't even need to store data.<br><br>
         * But if you need to store data, you have various solutions.<br><br>
         * As with everything in technology, nothing is ideal in every situation.<br><br>
         * Computers offer many various ways to store data. The most obvious
        alternative is <strong>files</strong><br><br>
         * A common example is a website. Some websites use a database to store data
        (like WordPress), some do not.<br><br>
         * Not using a database in that case means a simpler deploy to a hosting service,
        since you won’t need to use and maintain a database in the first place.<br><br>
         * But when handling lots of data, a database is definitely a great way to
        simplify your life in the long term.<br><br>
         * As always, it's all a balance of complexity vs convenience.<br><br>
