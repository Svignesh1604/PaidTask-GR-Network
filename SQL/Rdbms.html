    <h1> Relational Databases & SQL Basics</h1>

    <div id="q1" class="card">
      <h2>Relational Databases</h2>
      <p> * We have many different kinds of DBMS.<br><br>
        * Computer professionals experimented with many different options in the
        past, and one of these options got very popular: the <b>Relational Database
          Management System (RDBMS)</b>.<br><br>
        * For simplicity we generally call them <b>relational databases.</b><br><br>
        You might have heard of PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, MariaDB, SQL
        Server.<br><br>
        * Those are all relational databases.<br><br>
        Note the “SQL” in their name. They are also called SQL databases, to contrast
        NoSQL databases (like MongoDB or DynamoDB for example), which are
        DBMS that do not use this relational model and do not use SQL as their
        language.<br><br>
        * Relational databases under the hood organize data using two simple
        concepts:<b> tables </b> and <b>relations.</b><br><br>
        * This makes them very intuitive to use, because we are used to using tables to
        organize things. Think about an Excel or Google Sheets, for example.<br><br>
        * A relational database, at a first glance, is similar.<br><br>
        * Data is stored in one or more tables.<br><br>
        A <strong> table </strong> is a collection of items organized in rows and columns:<br><br>
        | Name | Age |<br>
        | ------ | --- |<br>
        | Tony | 36 |<br>
        | Rose | 28 |<br>
        | Juliet | 16 |<br><br>
        * Each table contains one or more <strong> columns </strong>, that hold data of a specific <b>type</b>,
        like strings, numbers and so on.<br><br>
        * The set of a table and all the rules about its columns, like the type of data
        stored, is called <b> schema.</b><br><br>
        * Each table can define <b> constrains </b> the data that each row can contain.
        For example, in the simplest case we can say that the value of a column
        cannot be empty.<br><br>
        * Tables can reference each other, forming relationships.<br><br>
        * For example we can say the row of the car table with id 1 is owned by
        the user assigned to id 2 in the table users .<br><br>
        * In this way we can link data together and build more complex applications.<br><br>
        * Relational databases offer us, users, the ability to interact with them through
        the <strong>SQL language.</strong><br><br>
        It looks like this:<br><br>
<div class="tag" >
        <b style="color: pink;">SELECT </b> * <b style="color: pink;">FROM</b> cars</div><br>
<div class="tag">
        <b style="color: pink;">INSERT INTO </b> cars <b style="color: pink;"> VALUES </b>(<b style="color: lightgreen;">'Lamborghini'</b>, <b style="color: orangered;">2010</b>)</div><br><br>

        * We use this language to define the tables <strong>schema</strong>, fill tables with data, and
        finally query the data when needed.<br><br>
        * The rest of this handbook will be focused on SQL.<br><br>
        * SQL is rather old, being born in 1986, and it's a battle-tested technology used
        in all sorts of applications.<br><br>

      <h2> Introduction to SQL</h2>
      <p>
        * SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language we use to interact with a
        Database Management System (DBMS) to exchange information with it, in a
        standardized way.<br><br>

        * As the name suggests, it's not a programming language, but it was born as a
        querying language, and later evolved to an interface to doing more advanced
        operations with a database than just performing queries.<br><br>

        * I said "evolved", but in reality SQL is always evolving. It's a standard that was
        first published in 1986, then updated in 1989, 1992, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008,
        2011, 2016 and as its latest version, 2019.<br><br>
        
        * SQL is implemented in many popular DBMS: Postgres, MySQL, Oracle,
        SQLite, MicroSoft SQL Server, and many more.<br><br>
        
        * Each different database implements the standard, or a particular version of
        it, and adds custom features on top of it, to simplify creating queries or
        adding a specific functionality.<br><br>

        * SQL is a huge subject, and you can literally spend years to master all its
        features.<br><br>

        * In this handbook we'll only cover the basics to get you up and running.<br><br>

         * I recommend you try running the SQL I explain in an online playground
        experimenting tool like<strong style="color: cornflowerblue;"> DB Fiddle </strong> similar.<br><br>

        * A great application to run SQL locally on your own database is <strong style="color: cornflowerblue;"> TablePlus.</strong><br><br>

        * As a developer in your applications in your day-to-day you might use a ORM
        (object relational mapping) library that abstracts SQL and simplifies your
        life, but it's absolutely essential to know how things work under the hood,
        and much of the terminology of ORMs reflect the underlying SQL naming
        conventions.<br><br>

        * Plus, some things are just doable using "plain SQL".<br><br>
        So, let's go!<br><br>
