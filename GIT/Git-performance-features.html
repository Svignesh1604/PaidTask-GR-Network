      <h2><u>Git</u></h2>
      <p>
        *  Git is a tool used to keep track of changes to files, especially the code of the projects.<br><br>

         * It is termed a distributed version control system because of its behaviour to allow multiple people to work on
        the same project, even if they are not connected to a common server.<br><br>

         * It was created by a person named Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.<br><br>

         * In this article, we will discuss Git, its features, advantages, and disadvantages.<br><br>

         * Git is a tool that helps you manage changes to your code over time.<br><br>

         * It keeps track of every little change or update you make, you can always look back at previous versions or undo
        mistakes if needed.<br><br>

         * In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind.<br><br>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="q2">
      <h2>
        <u>performance</u>
      </h2>
      <p>
         * The raw performance characteristics of Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives.<b style="font-style: italic;color: darkslategray;"> Committing new
        changes</b>,<b style="font-style: italic;color: darkslategray;"> branching</b>,<b style="font-style: italic;color: darkslategray;"> merging</b> and<b style="font-style: italic;color: darkslategray;"> comparing</b> past versions are all optimized for performance.<br><br>

         * The algorithms implemented inside Git take advantage of deep knowledge about common attributes of real source
        code file trees, how they are usually modified over time and what the access patterns are.<br><br>

         * Unlike some version control software, Git is not fooled by the names of the files when determining what the
        storage and version history of the file tree should be, instead, Git focuses on the file content itself. After
        all, source code files are frequently renamed, split, and rearranged.<br><br>

         * The object format of Git's repository files uses a combination of delta encoding (storing content differences),
        compression and explicitly stores directory contents and version metadata objects.<br><br>

         * Being distributed enables significant performance benefits as well.<br><br>

        <strong style="color: green;"><u> Example:</u></strong> <br><br>
        
         * say a developer, Alice, makes changes to source code, adding a feature for the upcoming 2.0
        release, then commits those changes with descriptive messages.<br><br>

         * She then works on a second feature and commits those changes too. Naturally these are stored as separate pieces
        of work in the version history.<br><br>

         * Alice then switches to the version 1.3 branch of the same software to fix a bug that affects only that older
        version.<br><br>

        *  The purpose of this is to enable Alice's team to ship a bug fix release, version 1.3.1, before version 2.0 is
        ready.<br><br>

         * Alice can then return to the 2.0 branch to continue working on new features for 2.0 and all of this can occur
        without any network access and is therefore fast and reliable.<br><br>

         * She could even do it on an airplane. When she is ready to send all of the individually committed changes to the
        remote repository, Alice can "push" them in one command.<br><br>
      </p>

      <h2><u>Features</u></h2>
      <p>
         * Version Control System: Git keeps track of every change you make to your project files. You can go back to
        previous versions is any requirement arises.<br><br>

        <b>Repositories:</b> <br><br>
        
         * A Git repository (or repo) is like a project's central hub where everything related to your work
        is stored and managed.<br><br>
        
        There are two main types:<br><br>

         * <b style="color: brown;">Local Repository: </b> This is a copy of the repository which is stored in your computer. You can work on your
        project and make changes here.<br><br>

        * <b  style="color: brown;"> Remote Repository: </b>  This is stored on a server, like GitHub, where you and others can share and work on a
        project.<br><br>


        * <b style="color: cornflowerblue;"> Commits:</b> Every time you make changes and save them in Git, these are called commits. The repository keeps track
        of all the commits you have made.<br><br>


         *<b style="color: cornflowerblue;"> Branches:</b> A repository allows you to create Branches and work on new features and fixes. For example, you can
        have a "main" branch for stable code and a "feature" branch for new features you're developing.<br><br>


        * <b style="color: cornflowerblue;"> Merging: </b> Once you are done with the branches you have made, you can merge those branches into main branch. This
        adds the changes you have made in the rest of the project.<br><br>

         *<b style="color: cornflowerblue;"> Cloning:</b> Cloning is a process of making a complete copy of Git repository. It's like copying the entire project
        from central location ( like website) to your own computer.<br><br>
